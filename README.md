### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

```
PROPER:
Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a text string.

=PROPER(A1)
```
```
CONCATENATE:
Combines two or more text strings into one.

=CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are the total sales from the copier (sub-cat) for economy shipping mode?
- What are the total sales from france in 2017?
- What are the total sales of Bookcases sold in Central region?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- The total sales from the copier for economy shipping mode is more than 57K.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Focus on expanding and promoting products.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target customers effectively.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
